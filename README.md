# **SYOS (Synex Outlet Store) Billing and Inventory System**

## **ðŸ“Œ Introduction**

**SYOS** is a **web-based, multi-tier, multi-user client-server application** designed for the **Synex Outlet Store in Colombo**. It streamlines **customer billing, inventory management, and transaction handling** in a concurrent environment. The system is optimized to **minimize manual errors, enhance transaction speed during peak hours, and maintain real-time inventory updates**, significantly improving store operations.

### **ðŸ›  Key Features**
âœ” **Multi-user, concurrent transactions** with thread safety mechanisms.  
âœ” **Optimized inventory management** with stock validation and automated restocking.  
âœ” **Token-based session isolation** to prevent session conflicts between users.  
âœ” **Clean Architecture and SOLID Principles** for scalability and maintainability.  
âœ” **Integration of 13 Design Patterns** to enhance code flexibility.  
âœ” **Concurrency Control using ReentrantLock, Optimistic Locking, and Connection Pooling.**

The system operates using **Java Servlets** running on **Apache Tomcat**, ensuring **multi-threaded request handling** for **high-performance, concurrent processing**.

## **ðŸ“Œ Prerequisites**

Before running the application, ensure the following dependencies are available in the `lib` folder:

ðŸ”¹ **Java Development Kit (JDK 11 or later)** â€“ Required to compile and run the application.  
ðŸ”¹ **Apache Tomcat 9+** â€“ The application server to deploy and manage Java Servlets.  
ðŸ”¹ **MySQL Database** â€“ Stores transactional and inventory data.  
ðŸ”¹ **JAR Dependencies:**
- `servlet-api.jar` (for Java Servlet functionalities).
- `mysql-connector-java.jar` (for database connectivity).
- Any additional required JDBC drivers.

ðŸ’¡ *Ensure that these dependencies are correctly configured before running the application.*

## **ðŸ“Œ Installation & Running the Application**

### **Step 1: Database Setup**
1. Install and configure **MySQL Server**.
2. Create a **new database** for the application.
3. Import the required SQL schema and seed data.

### **Step 2: Configure the Application**
1. Place the necessary **JAR files** in the `lib/` directory.
2. Configure **database connection settings** in the `DatabaseConnectionPool.java` file.

### **Step 3: Deploy to Apache Tomcat**
1. **Compile the project** using an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
2. Deploy the compiled **WAR file** to Tomcat (`webapps/` folder).
3. Start the **Tomcat server** and open a browser.
4. Access the application at:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080/syos
   ```

## **ðŸ“Œ Concurrency Handling & System Design**

ðŸš€ **The system is built for high-concurrency usage**, ensuring that multiple users can interact with the application seamlessly.

ðŸ”¹ **Concurrency Mechanisms Implemented:**
- **ReentrantLock** â†’ Prevents race conditions in **billing and stock updates**.
- **ExecutorService** â†’ Schedules **background tasks** for inventory restocking.
- **Token-Based Session Isolation** â†’ Ensures each userâ€™s session is independent.
- **Optimistic Locking** â†’ Prevents **data conflicts** in customer management.
- **Connection Pooling** â†’ Improves **database performance** under heavy loads.

This ensures **safe, concurrent access to critical system functionalities** without performance degradation.
